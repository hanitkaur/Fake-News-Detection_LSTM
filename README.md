# Fake-News-Detection_LSTM
Fake News Detection using LSTM
Introduction
Fake news has become a significant concern in the age of social media and digital information. Detecting and combating the spread of false information is crucial for maintaining the integrity of news and information sources. This repository focuses on the development of a machine learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to detect fake news articles.

# Project Overview

# Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

**Fake News Detection Model**: Develop an LSTM-based machine learning model to identify fake news articles from genuine ones.

**Data Preprocessing**: Prepare and preprocess textual data, including text cleaning, tokenization, and embedding.

**Model Training:** Train the LSTM model on labeled data to learn the patterns and characteristics of fake news articles.

**Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using relevant evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project comprises a collection of news articles labeled as either "fake" or "real." It serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the fake news detection model.

## Fake News Detection Model (LSTM)

The LSTM-based model is designed to analyze the textual content of news articles and classify them as fake or genuine. LSTM networks are well-suited for sequential data, making them an ideal choice for natural language processing tasks.

**Data Preprocessing**

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in text-based machine learning projects. It involves tasks such as text cleaning (removing noise and irrelevant characters), tokenization (breaking text into words or tokens), and word embedding (representing words as numerical vectors).

**Model Training**

The LSTM model is trained on the preprocessed data to learn the underlying patterns that distinguish fake news from real news. Training involves optimizing model parameters to achieve the best possible performance.

**Evaluation**

To assess the model's effectiveness, it is evaluated on a separate dataset or through cross-validation. Metrics such as accuracy (the percentage of correctly classified articles), precision (the ratio of true positives to all predicted positives), recall (the ratio of true positives to all actual positives), and F1-score (a combination of precision and recall) are commonly used to evaluate model performance.

## Usage

This repository contains the following components:

**Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

**Datasets:** Labeled datasets used for model training and evaluation.

**Documentation:** Detailed documentation on the methodology, model performance, and usage instructions.
